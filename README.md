# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR
* we have four functions for the basic arithmetic operations. We take two numbers as input from the user and call the respective function based on the user's choice.

* We use a while loop to repeatedly perform calculations until the user decides to exit.

* The program continues to ask for a new input, performing the requested operation, and then asking if the user wants to continue     calculating until the user types 'no'.

* Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
* The game ends when one player completes a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (X or O), or when the board is full.
* The player who achieves this first is declared the winner, or the game ends in a draw if no winner is found.
