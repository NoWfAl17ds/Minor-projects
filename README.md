# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR
we have four functions for the basic arithmetic operations. We take two numbers as input from the user and call the respective function based on the user's choice.

We use a while loop to repeatedly perform calculations until the user decides to exit.

The program continues to ask for a new input, performing the requested operation, and then asking if the user wants to continue calculating until the user types 'no'.
