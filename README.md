# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR
* we have four functions for the basic arithmetic operations. We take two numbers as input from the user and call the respective function based on the user's choice.

* We use a while loop to repeatedly perform calculations until the user decides to exit.

* The program continues to ask for a new input, performing the requested operation, and then asking if the user wants to continue     calculating until the user types 'no'.

* Players : The game is played between two players, traditionally represented by "X" and "O" symbols.
* Game Board : The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell on the grid.
* Winning Condition : A player wins the game if they successfully place three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
* Draw Condition : If all cells on the grid are filled, and no player has achieved a winning condition, the game ends in a draw.
* Turn Alternation : Players take turns to make their moves, starting with one player placing their symbol, followed by the other player placing theirs.
* Valid Moves : Players can only place their symbol in an empty cell on the grid. Once a cell is occupied, it cannot be used again in the same game.
* End of Game : The game ends when one player achieves a winning condition, or when all cells on the grid are filled, resulting in a draw.
